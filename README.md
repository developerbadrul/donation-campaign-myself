# Donation Campaign

Enhance your donation platform with these key features:-

- Donation Tracking and History
Create a user dashboard to view donation history, the total amount donated, and the impact of contributions. This feature motivates users and demonstrates the real-world difference they've made.

- Donations Chart
Add a visually appealing chart to display donation statistics, including category distribution (e.g., Health, Food). Utilize libraries like Chart.js for easy implementation.

- Set Background Color
Improve the platform's design by applying background colors to different sections, aligning with your platform's theme. You can use CSS styles or frameworks like Tailwind CSS for effortless implementation.
